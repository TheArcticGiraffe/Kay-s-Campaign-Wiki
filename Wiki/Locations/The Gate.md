Parent Location:: [[The Cavern]]

### Description
A large suspended city, suspended by enormous vertical chains at the top of [[The Cavern|the Cavern]]. The largest city within the Cavern. Has a pretty even mix of surface and underdark species. There is also a great mingling of cultures (think New York City).

The city is slightly overcrowded due to the influx of surface dwellers, but is able to sustain itself through the food produced in the [[Lightlands]].

After a few near miss incidents, the city made a massive [[Gate Anti-Magic Field|anti-magic field]] that encapsulates the entire city. While within the field, magic is impossible to use by default, unless you have a key card which let's you bypass the field at a certain capacity.

The city is ruled by a council, made up of 50% dwarves and 50% duergar. 

At the base of the city there is an elevator, granting access to the base of [[The Cavern|the Cavern]], setting down at the center of the [[Lightlands]].

### History

Was the main access point to the surface, until the entrance was sealed off following [[The Cataclysm|the Cataclysm]]. As legend tells, within a matter of weeks of the cataclysm occurring, the entrance was sealed off.

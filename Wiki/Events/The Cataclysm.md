### Description
A massive catastrophic event that occurred nearly a millennium ago, resulting in the surface world being wiped out. The cause is not knowns; some believe it to be the punishment of the gods, some believe it to be the hubris of a powerful lich, and yet other believe it to be a cataclysmic natural disaster.

Many survivors rushed to [[The Gate]] as a way to save themselves by escaping into the underdark.

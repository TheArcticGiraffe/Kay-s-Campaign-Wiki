While living in the [[The Gate]], each of our intrepid heroes took interest in jobs being offered by [[The Institute of Collective Knowledge]]. The first job that we have been given is fairly simple; to collect a piece of [[The Mycelium Keep|the Keep] located in the [[Mycelium Grove]] and return it to [[The Institute of Collective Knowledge|the Institute]].

Each of our characters took interest in a flyer they saw posted around the city, and were guided to meet up here.

We open on the contractors in the elevator, waiting to be lowered into the cavern. An elderly dwarf in a grubby city uniform is operating the controls, and as the 4 characters get settled, he begins the operation of the elevator. Unseen gears start clanking and the 20 minute ride to the floor of the Cavern begins.

During the ride down, [[Albreich]], [[Dank]], [[Darius Pleasure|Darius]], and [[Khasiira Maeafin-Lofthouse|Khasiira]] all introduce themselves.

After several minutes, the elevator comes to a halt. [[Lightlands|The farm lands]] here are echoes of what must have been on the surface. In the distance, the cavern takes shape. It stretches countless miles in each direction, and miles upward as well. 

Before the operator continues upward, he passes a small chest to the group. When asked what it is, he gives a non-committal shrug before returning the elevator to [[The Gate|the Gate]]. 

Albreich opens the chest, which reveals a normal piece of paper. After a moment, it comes to life and begins talking like a mouth.

> "Hello my brave adventurers. Simply extract a piece of the keep. When you close it with the correct specimen, it will teleport back to me." 
>  - [[Byron]].

We have been instructed to go to the [[Mycelium Grove]] located about a half a day's walk from the elevator. Luckily, Albreich is familiar with the way.

The Farmlands is very safe, and we pass a lot of people while we walk. It is very urban. 

Once we are out of the light, it is quite serene. The bioluminescent moss is violet during the early morning part of our journey. As we approach the edge of the [[Mycelium Grove]] around midday, the moss begins taking on a blueish tint. The party begins walking into the Grove; the path continues, narrowing slightly as the fungal canopy closes up overhead. A lot of the fungus is fluorescing in some way; it's not dark, but is a different kind of light from the moss.

About 20 minutes into the Grove (which Albreich knows is about halfway to the Keep), the party notices that there is no one passing as they leave [[The Keep]]. This is strange, as the Keep is a hub of trade, and not normally this devoid of travelers. Shortly after noticing this, the party notices a figure standing in the middle of the road, As we get closer, we see it is an elderly Firbolg, holding on to staff out of necessity. He squints his eyes, and then smiles in a pleasantly surprised way.

We explain that we are 
"Ah, what are you doing around here?"

"Bad news right now. (Irish accent). Some thing been fucking about. Getting everything all weird and corrupted. The damn thing won't let us near to look. Cleared the entire keep out. Everyone's turned back, no ones there. What's our "

"We're doing some work "


"Know anything about it?"

One of the creatures, a Myconid, fucking huge and feeding off the keep. Entire thing is yellow, never been that color.

Darius talks about 


We could deal with it.


Got some folks coming in to help. Just don't get yourselves killed. Dennis.



As we start coming up on a turn, can see that all of the fungus next to the road is turning a sickly yellow color. Arond the turn, can hear crashing and noise being made by something.


Dank sneaks up. Keep comes into view. Tall interconnected tower. Down at the center going in and out and fucking about, huge myconid thing. Twisted and fucked up, all fours, running around, patrolling. Goes directly to the keep, connects to it, and more yellow seeps out.

Might have been 10ft tall.

Come around the corner, Khas trips and makes noise

Extra eyes, extra limbs. 

Pushes the myconid to the ground, grapples it

Darius runs to the side, blasts this mother fucker, still looking in relatively good health.

Albreich comes up and stabs at it. Dank comes up and attacks it as well, attempts to hide but then fails.

Yellow sickliness is still there.

Hog tie the creature.

Look around. Kill the thing, deflates, gross yellow color drains out of it.

Turns an ivory color. Seems to seep all of the yellow yucky surrounding fungus. Doesn't die like normal things die. Turns into a pile of old dried mushroom.

Go cut off a piece of the tower. Put in the box, it shakes and then stops. Little note and bag in there.

Note: Childish but done by a grown man guy giving two thumbs up. Older tabaxi with big nerdy glasses.

200GP. 50GP each.

This is not just one job. Just do things for the nerds who don't leave the city.

All kind of shaking it off. Dennis comes up, looking shaken.

We explain to dennis what happened, he grabs some of the dead mushroom.

Take short rest, start heading back. The bioluminescent moss is going to a deep green. Close enough to the Gate that we get tacky artificial moonlight. 

Everyone except Darius, movement in the ditch. Who is in the ditch? As we notice, see the glint of fake moonlight off of swords.

- Solved the bandit puzzle.

Dust settles, a little bit shell shocked. Getting ambushed this close to the city is bizarre. So close we can see farm houses. Technically patrolled by the city watch of The Gate. Can't have been here long, it would take a lot of luck to survive. Any criminals working this closed to the city.

Pat down the biggie, 15copper, a few days of shitty rations. As patting down, under the armor pull out an amulet. Has a 13 pointed sun on it. The top point is shaped to be an arrow. No contract.

Darius and Dank know it to be similar to a sigil worn by members of a religious group, sigil of the Order of the Sun. Church in the city that does perfectly normal stuff; feed the poor, regular church shit. Very weird, seeing as they attacked us. Not entirely the same, the arrow on the top is different.

Other folks have the same contract, signed by some guy. Big swooping L.

- Details of the contract. Basic mercenary contract. Hired for some reason to work for this guy. Any details are not mentioned in the contract.


Move the bodies off the road to avoid hazard. 

Make it back to [[The Gate]].

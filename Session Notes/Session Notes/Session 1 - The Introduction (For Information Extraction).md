Extra eyes, extra limbs. 

Go cut off a piece of the tower. Put in the box, it shakes and then stops. Little note and bag in there.

Note: Childish but done by a grown man guy giving two thumbs up. Older tabaxi with big nerdy glasses.

200GP. 50GP each.

This is not just one job. Just do things for the nerds who don't leave the city.

- Solved the bandit puzzle.

Dust settles, a little bit shell shocked. Getting ambushed this close to the city is bizarre. So close we can see farm houses. Technically patrolled by the city watch of The Gate. Can't have been here long, it would take a lot of luck to survive. Any criminals working this closed to the city.

Pat down the biggie, 15copper, a few days of shitty rations. As patting down, under the armor pull out an amulet. Has a 13 pointed sun on it. The top point is shaped to be an arrow. No contract.

Darius and Dank know it to be similar to a sigil worn by members of a religious group, sigil of the Order of the Sun. Church in the city that does perfectly normal stuff; feed the poor, regular church shit. Very weird, seeing as they attacked us. Not entirely the same, the arrow on the top is different.

Other folks have the same contract, signed by some guy. Big swooping L.

- Details of the contract. Basic mercenary contract. Hired for some reason to work for this guy. Any details are not mentioned in the contract.


Move the bodies off the road to avoid hazard. 

Make it back to [[The Gate]].

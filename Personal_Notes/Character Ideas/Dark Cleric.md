# Backstory

Name: Malda Summerberry
Species: Halfling (Stout)
Class: Cleric, Life Domain


- A cleric who gives off every impression of being a cleric of a good deity, but is actually a cultist for a dark eldritch god. 

Cleric of life domain. Halfling from a nearby surface community. Very big follower of the biggest best deity. Goes on mission trip to the underdark. Is set up here for a while, working at a local temple. Head out on some sort of expedition to another city or something. Witnesses her whole party be massacred by one underdark beast, and then that underdark beast being killed by something bigger. Has a sort of mental snap. Unable to process the loss of her love, Begins following a dark eldritch being, or concept, of pain and suffering, as a way to deal with the trauma and give some meaning to the loss of her partner. Is looking to maximize the amount of suffering and pain in the world. Supports bad things, and now solely goes on dangerous expeditions with adventuring parties in order to keep them alive to continue causing mayhem. 

Seems to forward the progress of civilization, and causing as much damage, bloodshed, and carnage as possible. 

Has the entire vibe of following this other diety, but holy symbol does not match that. 

Hidden holy symbol inside of the other holy symbol. Something weird and fucked up. 

Her partner died in her parties death, and she keeps some grim memento of her (piece of skull, specific bone, somehow entrails, etc) preserved heart?????

After her party died, she sought out a book of dark cleric magic, basically a devil worship book. Had to sneak it from somewhere high security at her church, and used it to learn some of the dark spells that she has access to. 

By keeping this grim reminder of her partner, keeps the pain alive. Never let’s herself move on from it. This is her arc. Getting to the point of being able to fully grieve and move on. 

Is using the animate dead spell to keep her loved one alive? Maybe trying to keep it under her control (recast the spell every 24 hours), but she definitely has them animated. Maybe just their head in a part of their bag. 

All of her other possessions are from the other people in her party. Her armor, her sword/other weapon, 
Like all her armor, it’s a bunch of mismatched pieces. Not clear why to others, but each piece was from one of her teammates? 

After the accident, started getting really into tattooing and piercing. Has excessive piercing and tattooing and piercing as I way to endure pain.

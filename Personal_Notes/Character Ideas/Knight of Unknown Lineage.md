# Backstory

Name: Khasiira (Khas) Maeafin-Lofthouse
Dead Names: Kalraen

Age: 26yrs
Height: 5ft7in (Maybe shorter)
Weight: 160lb 

Class: Fighter 6 - Abominable Lineage (Rune Knight reskin) 

Khas is the only daughter (maybe?) of Augustus Lofthouse and Dresmar Maeafin. She grew up in the city of The Gate, spending her childhood going to school and helping in her fathers' shop during her free time. She always loved being in the store, seeing the things that her father's contacts and friends would bring in for sale, meeting all the incredible adventurers who came by, and hearing stories about the far reaches of the Cavern.

While when she was first born, everyone thought she was a boy, very early on she made it clear she was in fact, a girl. Her parents both readily accepted her, and did everything they could to allow her to flourish as her true self, regardless of any of the distaste they received from her Papa's family. Everyone else in their life was also incredibly accepting, and if they weren't, they stopped being a part of their life.

As she grew, she took the necessary potions in order to halt her masculine development. When her and her family determined that she was in fact ready for it, she began HRT in order to start her puberty into womanhood, at the age of 14.

She continued the rest of her childhood uneventfully. She dealt with a share of bigots, but growing up with her father and all of her aunts, uncles, and other family, she was very familiar with engaging in combat, and so she handled herself fine. 

When she finished her schooling, she initially began pursuing helping out with the family business, and began to take on more of a role at the shop. However, she slowly began to yearn for a greater adventure.

She is a trans woman, working contract jobs as a guard for various expeditions into the underdark. She thinks she is some fairly common race of the underdark (probably drow or something similar), but as she gets further in her hormonal transition (or the in-world equivalent), she starts developing the abilities and features of something else, something eldritch/abyssal/under-fae or whatever. 

  

What she doesn’t know is that her other parent was not a typical denizen of the Underdark. They were/are a powerful being, and their abilities within her were dormant until she started hormones. 

==From Kay: Oh! Have you thought much about your background stuff? I was thinking for Plot Reasons your character could have two dads
I am totally down for her having two dads, that sounds dope. Do you think she would have grown up around both of them?
Oh yep, as far as she knows theyre her only parents
  

Mother was an adventurer in her youth, has since settled down to run a shop that specializes in rare items and ingredients. Uses her old adventuring contacts to get the best loot. This is how PC  got enthralled with adventuring, through seeing all the loot and hearing all the stories. Maybe has connections throughout the underdark, all her moms contacts who are kind of like her aunts/uncles/piblings. 

Weapon of choice; Longsword and Warhammer as an extra weapon. 

Might Wield a shield. It gets dicey 
  

Is kind of a horny adventurer type. Always interested in seducing someone in the taverns they find themselves in. But they do have someone they’re deeply smitten for back home. Poly relationship, mostly in the sense of an open relationship while she is off doing work. 

  

Mechanically, I am wanting to make a fighter, using a reflavoured Rune Knight subclass. Instead of the runes being something she learnt, they are manifestations of her new abilities from her other parent. Instead of them being represented by runes on her gear, they are instead represented by strange/spooky body features (extra eyes, altered limbs, horns, changed skin, etc), depending on what bonuses and abilities the rune gives and what the parent’s species is. As well, the “Giant’s Might” feature that lets you become large and do more damage would be flavoured as taking on a more monstrous form.

  

My questions for you are:

- what sorts of species/races are common where we are in the underdark? What are the restrictions on PC race, if there are any?
- What sort of creature might PC’s other parent be. I am open to either knowing this, or having it be secret and having you describe to me the kind of features she might be developing. 
- How would a being trans work in this world? What would be the closest thing to hormones?
- How is transness and queerness seen in this world, and in the underdark specifically?
- Is the re-skinning of the Rune Knight subclass okay with you?
- What level are we starting at?

  

Character concept trans fighter who has some sort of eldritch/patron powers (time to multiclass or find a good fighter subclass / or sorcerer subclass that deals in fighting. Mom is either eldritch herself, made a deal with patron, or had sex with greater being. Need to have this greater being as her dad. Have a boyfriend, maybe trans masc. good relationship with her mom. For Kay’s  campaign.

She started off not displaying any of her other parents traits, but when she started taking hormones/whatever, she started showing abyssal/far/eldritch traits. There are key family members who are uncomfortable about it (flesh this out more, leave as a hook for Kay). Need to confirm with Kay, might not fit the tone.

  

Could also be Barbarian sorcerer/if that exists. Traits come out in rage. Emotions are conveyed through features and how much comes out.

## Class Features

### Giant's Might (3rd lvl Rune Knight)

You have learned how to imbue yourself with the might of giants. As a bonus action, you magically gain the following benefits, which last for 1 minute:

- If you are smaller than Large, you become Large, along with anything you are wearing. If you lack the room to become Large, your size doesn't change.
- You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
- Once on each of your turns, one of your attacks with a weapon or an unarmed strike can deal an extra 1d6 damage to a target on a hit.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

### Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the [Attack](https://5e.tools/actions.html#attack_phb) action on your turn.

## Feats

### Skill Expert
You have honed your proficiency with particular skills, granting you the following benefits:
- Increase one ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- You gain proficiency in one [skill](https://5e.tools/tables.html#skills_phb) of your choice.
- Choose one skill in which you have proficiency. You gain expertise with that skill, which means your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make with it. The skill you choose must be one that isn't already benefiting from a feature, such as Expertise, that doubles your proficiency bonus.

## Ability Scores

Order of the stats, highest to lowest
- CON, STR, (DEX <-> WIS), CHA, INT

Really likes fighting. Focuses on it. Is a bit wily. Has wisdom for sussing people out a bit, maybe have that above DEX. Charisma is low because of her hiding a part of who she is in general society. Low intelligence, not stupid, but just because she was never that interested in books. 

### ASI INCREASES:

- Half-Elf Drow Descent: 2-1-1 to different skills
- LVL4 ASI: 1 from [`Skill Expert`](https://5e.tools/feats.html#skill%20expert_tce) feat.
- LVL6 ASI: 2 from ASI


Have 7 ASI increase points. 2-1-1 (4 total) must go to different skills, and the remaining 3 can be used as desired. Probably going to do something like 3 to CON, 3 to STR, and 1 to DEX/WIS.

## Background

Mercenary Veteran, with Athletics and Persuasion.

Worked in mercenary companiesC but never stuck with one. Always joined companies that needed extra hands for a job. 

You know the mercenary life as only someone who has experienced it can. You are able to identify mercenary companies by their emblems, and you know a little about any such company, including who has hired them recently. You can find the taverns and festhalls where mercenaries abide in any area, as long as you speak the language. You can find mercenary work between adventures sufficient to maintain a comfortable lifestyle

## Fighting Style Options

##### **Blind Fighting (TCE)** 
You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.

## Runes Favoured

(SM = From Source Books, HB = Homebrew)

#### Any Level

##### **1. [Stone Rune (SM)](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/fighter:rune-knight)** 

This rune's magic channels the judiciousness associated with stone giants. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks, and you have darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

In addition, when a creature you can see ends its turn within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to invoke the rune and force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. Unless the save succeeds, the creature is charmed by you for 1 minute. While charmed in this way, the creature has a speed of 0 and is incapacitated, descending into a dreamy stupor. The creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

THOUGHTS: I think all of the abilities for this one could lend themselves very well to an unknown underdark parent. 

##### **2. [Journey Rune (HB)](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MY42LKyo_oWKGfvmB5P)**
This rune readies you for travel. While you are wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, your walking speed increases by 10 feet, and you cannot become lost except by magical means.

In addition, you may invoke this rune as an action. For the next 10 minutes, your jumping distances are doubled, and you gain a climbing speed and a swimming speed of 20 feet each. Once you have invoked this rune, you may not do so again until you have finished a short or long rest.

THOUGHTS: I love the versatility of this one, being able to climb and swim. Gives off monstrous vibes. As well, having 10ft more movement sounds really cool! Being able to chase down an enemy faster than they can run is also so monstrous. 

##### **3. [War Rune (HB)](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MY42LKyo_oWKGfvmB5P)** 

This rune evokes the vigilance of the practiced warrior. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on initiative rolls, and on Wisdom (Perception) checks.

In addition, you may invoke the rune as an action, unleashing a mighty warcry. Until the start of your next turn, all friendly creatures that could hear your cry may roll 1d6 and add the result to each of their attack rolls and ability checks that use Strength or Dexterity. Once you have invoked this rune, you may not do so again until you have finished a short or long rest.

THOUGHTS: Having advantage on initiative seems so cool, as well as to perception checks. Really works for being hired muscle for an expedition. As well, the mighty war cry feels like such a primal/monstrous thing to do. 

##### **4. [Frost Rune (SM)](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/fighter:rune-knight)** 
This rune's magic evokes the might of those who survive in the wintry wilderness, such as frost giants. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks and Charisma (Intimidation) checks.

In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus action to increase your sturdiness. For 10 minutes, you gain a +2 bonus to all ability checks and saving throws that use Strength or Constitution. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

THOUGHTS: I like the advantage on intimidation, and animal handling is interesting. The invokable ability is very interesting. Especially if I want to work towards a Grapple build, the boost would work nicely. 

##### **5. [Fire Rune (SM)](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/fighter:rune-knight)** 

This rune's magic channels the masterful craftsmanship of great smiths. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses your proficiency with a tool.

In addition, when you hit a creature with an attack using a weapon, you can invoke the rune to summon fiery shackles: the target takes an extra 2d6 fire damage, and it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained for 1 minute. While restrained by the shackles, the target takes 2d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, banishing the shackles on a success. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

THOUGHTS: I like the shackles in this one, but not sure about having them deal fire damage. As well, the proficiency being doubled for proficiency with tools doesn’t much match her, for what I can tell. But maybe it could be a backstory thing. 

#### 7th Level Or Higher

##### **[Hill Rune (SM) (7th Level or Higher)](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/fighter:rune-knight)** 
This rune's magic bestows a resilience reminiscent of a hill giant. While wearing or carrying an object that bears this rune, you have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and you have resistance against poison damage.

In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus action, gaining resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage for 1 minute. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

##### **[Storm Rune (SM) (7th Level or Higher)](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/fighter:rune-knight)** 
Using this rune, you can glimpse the future like a storm giant seer. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks, and you can't be surprised as long as you aren't incapacitated.

In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus action to enter a prophetic state for 1 minute or until you're incapacitated. Until the state ends, when you or another creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, you can use your reaction to cause the roll to have advantage or disadvantage. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

##### **[Blood Rune (HB) (7th Level or Higher)](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MY42LKyo_oWKGfvmB5P)** 
This rune commands the dark power of blood and the life force within creatures. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you gain a +2 bonus to hit points you restore to yourself when rolling hit dice or when using your Second Wind feature.

In addition, when you hit a creature with an attack using a weapon, you can invoke the rune to draw the life energy from it: the target takes an additional 2d6 necrotic damage, and you regain a number of hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt. Once you have invoked this rune, you may not do so again until you have finished a short or long rest.

##### **[Death Rune (HB) (7th Level or Higher)](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MY42LKyo_oWKGfvmB5P)** 
This otherwise innocuous rune holds the heavy weight of the inevitability of death. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have resistance to necrotic damage.

In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus action, channelling the spectre of death itself for 1 minute: you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls using weapons, and your weapon attacks gain an additional 5 feet of Reach. Once you have invoked this rune, you may not do so again until you have finished a short or long rest.

##### **[Enemy Rune (HB) (7th Level or Higher)](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MY42LKyo_oWKGfvmB5P)** 
This rune marks you, taunting your foes with the presence of their most hated enemy. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on weapon attack rolls against any creature that dealt damage to you in the last turn.

In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus action to raise a creature’s ire. A creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has disadvantage on weapon attack rolls against all creatures other than you for 1 minute, or until you attack a creature other than it. Once you have invoked this rune, you may not do so again until you have finished a short or long rest.

##### **[Shield Rune (HB) (7th Level or Higher)](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MY42LKyo_oWKGfvmB5P)** 
This rune protects its wielder from harm. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, your armour class increases by 1 and you gain a +1 bonus to all your saving throws.

In addition, when you are targeted with an attack, you may invoke the rune as a reaction, gaining a +5 bonus to your armour class against that attack, and all further attacks until the start of your next turn. Once you have invoked this rune, you may not do so again until you have finished a short or long rest.

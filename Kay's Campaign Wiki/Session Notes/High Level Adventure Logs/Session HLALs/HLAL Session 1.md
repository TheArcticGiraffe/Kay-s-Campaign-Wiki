## Session 1 - The Introduction

### Day 1

- We open on our party of adventurers, as the elevator doors to the cavern under the Gate close and their journey down begins
	- The party introduces themselves to eachother.
	- As they leave the elevator, the operator passes us a chest. We learn from a note that this is how we will return a piece of the Keep to Byron.
- Make our way towards the Keep in the Mycelium Grove, about a half-day's journey
- Make our way into the Mycelium Grove, and it is oddly empty of travelers. About 1/2 way to the Keep we run into an elderly Firbolg named Dennis.
	- Dennis explains that there is a abnormally large infected Myconid who is rampaging at the Keep and infecting the surrounding grove. Everyone has been evacuated, and there is help on the way.
	- We continue onwards.
- Dank sneaks up, and see's the creature. Returns to the party and relays the information.
- Khas and Albreich attempt to approach it, but Khas stumbles, and combat ensues.
	- Not without some good beating, the party defeats the creature. Upon it's death, the sickly yellowness leaves the Keep, and we are able to put a piece in the chest given by Byron. 
	- This returns the piece of Keep to Byron, and our job is complete
- Dennis comes our way, and is visibly shaken at the fact we defeated it.
- Head back towards the elevator, and along the way get jumped by some bandits. 
	- We defeat them handily, and discover a sigil resembling the holy symbol of the Order of the Sun. As well, there are multiple generic contracts held by each of the bandits.
- Return to the Gate.

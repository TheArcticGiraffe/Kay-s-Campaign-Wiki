# Session Notes

They decide to head to the local watering hole for hired swords, [[The Hole in the Wall|the Hole]], as all their other leads will be unavailable until morning. 

The shitty tavern where all the low-lifes hang out.

As they enter the tavern, they see what Khas knows to be the normal crowd packed inside. There is a haze in the air, and the smell of working folks and cheap alcohol. 

Khas approaches the dwarven bartender, and sees the familiar face of Geoff manning the bar. 

- [ ] Geoff speaks with a Kiwi accent

3c for the beer.

Ask Geoff about the contract. Geoff doesn't know about it, or the L.

Ask Geoff about the sigil. Pretty fancy, looks like the Order's sigil, but doesn’t know 

At the church, Lots of different folks, majority traditionally surface dwelling races. Half the congregation is elf/half elf.

Dank is familiar, let you sleep at night if you don't have anywhere to go, soup kitchen stuff.

Dank recognizes the head priest. Bennet, older portly half-elf. Talking to the people who are here.

"Oh hello, my little one" - Bennet. 

Bennet thinks that Dank is a child.

"You've come for your morning treat"

Gives Dank two muffins, and ruffles hair.

Bennet is weirded out that we adults are hanging out with Dank, and she is employed.

"Interested in coming in to the light"

Albreich grabs out the sigil. Bennet, definitely been offshoots of their religion. A relic of a different time. Something of an antiquity

Not affiliated with our organization.

Bennett is something of a religious historian himself. Not much on the gone sects of the order. Not a lot.

- [ ] Find a religious historian

Flavour: Church has one church in the city. Big, magnificent, oldest in the city that is original. Draped in big banners with the sigil, red fabric gold theme. That's their marketing colors. Very Roman Catholic. 

Bennett seems down to earth, helps less fortunate. Dressed in luxurious red robe and golden sash. 4 stories, big vaulted ceilings.

Bennet rambled about the sigil a bit. hiding something or is anxious we are inquiring about it. 

We distract Bennett, and Dank goes to sneak in.

No one else in there, long cathedral, big alter at the end. Office, locked door.

Small office, clutered, papers and stuff, filing cabinets and book cases. Open filing cabinets. In the desk, one of the long shallow desks with a keyhole Dank attempts to pick in, but it seizes and locks up. 

Nothing of interest. Sneak out to report back to colleagues.

Bennett knows something, but nervous that he got asked about it.

Head to the Institute. ROck up to the institute.

Suprisingly small, first floor of a larger building. Paper sign, with the same hand drawn tabaxi nerd.

Press the buzzer. 

"Good morning my wonderful employees.”

Open the door. Suprisingly well put together laboratory.  Not just Byron, a few other pepole tinkering, doing science. Studying samples. Tall lanky tabaxi, jaunts up. Haven't met in person.

How was the first trip. Fantastic sample.

Any trouble? Give him the lowdown about the Myconid.  Didn;t know anything about the Myconid, it seems.

Now that proven yourself, can send you on next little adventure. This last one was Pretty near the city, next one is quite a ways out. Almost all the way to the west. There's a lead on a creature of some sort that seems to be causing a fuss. Definitely piqued interest. Not something that would usually be there. Causing a rucus in local town. Not too put off, if we were to deal with it and send a piece.

Whatever sticks out, send it back. Sounds like it's something dangerous, grab the dangerous bit.

One road, go west until something attacks you. An old friend of mine, in the border town Lookout. Cob. Can point you in specific direction.

Gonna need something beefier than that. Takes the chest, throws it aside, crashes arond in room, comes back with dark blue ribbon. 

"Essentially the same idea. Tie it around it, and it will mark it for my boys.

Willing to do 150GP each. 

Any deets about the town? Flying beast. Coming in at night, snatching up livestock and a few children. No one got a good look at it.



"I love mud" - Dank



Hurries us on the way, People doing science shit to the sample we already delivered.

Darius looks at it. Assistant is trying to use sample as a bridge between two rats. Trying to connect them in some way.

Halfling woman, big loxadon, pretty diverse group. Nice stuff, lab has clearly not been here for a long time.


"Byron, you should focus on getting permits"
"Don't go throwing aroudn words like permit and legal."

Albreich makes the joke that if you’re looking to get counterfeit permits, Darius would be your guy. 

Wander down to dad's pawn shop. Walk in, it’s giving overfilled antique store. Furniture, and a bunch of stuff. Dresser and stoll and hurtch all piled together, Locked cabinets full of stuff. Kind of trinkets. More household objects. Pretty robust weapon selection

A little hazy, incense. Room full of 50+ year old shit.

Yeah, just a second. COmes out, throws a rag over his shoulder. Tall broad human chunky man. Big beard, reddish hair, ruddy complexion.


Show him the sigil and the contract.

Shakes his head and brings down a pair of reading glasses. 

Shouts to “Dres”

Very tall drow man. Close to 7ft tall. NOt a morning riser. Long silver hair, back in a braid, very fancy housecoat. Comes and gives Khas a hug. Very fancy aloof vibes. 

Reads it a couple of times.

Dresmar thinks we were targetted. A couple fairly distant colleagues, take up contracts, go out and never come back. All these fellows were not the cream of the crop. "Don't associate with amateurs" interesting that you were so close to town. Not exactly sure. Gonna keep it and reach out to contracts.

A vase full of old cop night-sticks.

Club, and passes over the shop first aid kit.

Huge array of glasses with fancy umbrellas. Darius buys a few. This cabinet is a secret from Dres 

Head down the elevator. Same olf dwarf.

The Lightlands is the Farmlands.

Doors open, pleasantly surprised to find a carriage. 

Carriage starts ripping down the road. Wholly uneventful ride.

Takes the better part of the day. As coming in to town, see on the horizon. Kind of plains we are coming through. A couple of lights and structures. A water tower. Old west yee-haw flavour. One strip of road.

As we start coming in. DUsty plains, tumble weed. Can see huge trees with huge dark swampy forest. Lookout sits on the edge of it. km-1.5 of transition 

Carriage comes to a stop, dust settles. There are three commercial businesses, general store, a large butcher's shop (vast majority is hunted game, meat, hide). Also have a few small livestock, mostly for town use, not export. Further from the Gate, the more underdarky it gets. Gentrification's a bitch. A lot of the people out here. A couple of humans and dwarves. The community looks to be mostly drow. Carriage pulled by two horses. In a pen nearby, two huge horse-sized beetles. In a corral.

You've never seen a horse'n'buggy.

Tavern is the third commercial business.


Go into the tavern. Piano stops, floorboard creaks. people stop and stare.

GO up to the bartender. A very old looking harddone by human.

Points is toward cob. The bartender has a Lip full of dip. Old drow man sitting nursing a glass of whisky.

"I love mud".

Can;t go out the front door past nighttime, else you get something swoop down and take you.

Cheap Whisky, bring one to Cob

Darius introduces us. 

"Mighty kind of you to do."

Come to talk to you about the beast that's been about town.

Ah, Byron, ran with him a long time ago. Damn decent of ya, gotta say, it's been a problem around here for the better part of 5/6 years.


Begins explaining. 

About 6 years ago, this thing started going missing. First garbage, then it took Old Lady's cay. Then it started to go after the MudBugs, started to take sheep, most recently that fucking thing made off with John's youngest, Delmar. Ain't been seen. Maybe 3 weeks.

Ain't able to do what we want to do: hunt, kill shit, and make money off of it. Thing's better than us, this place's abandoned.

Only striking at night.

Starting to get dark. Looks out. Got maybe 15 minutes of definite safety, then 1-2 hours of dicey, 

Tell Bill it's on Cob. AS long as we are taking care of the Night Terror.

Try and track it in the morning. Leaves big black oily feathers. Big for a bird.sHOULD BE able to track it back during the day.

Albreich see's one of the feathers outside the. Disturbingly big, seems to belong some kind of bird. Hunting pattern makes think of some kind of predator bird, way to big to be something we would recognize.

Albreich determines it to be non-magical.

### Session
Scene by scene description

- As we sit there and relax, begin to notice that there's a lot more sound. Sounds like we're in a forrested area, hear the insects and twigs snapping and other wildlife, see birds flying around. Makes us really notice how abnormal it was before

- Go to investigate the house. Root through the remaining cupboards, bunch of old stuff, find some very old moth-eaten clothes in a dresser.
- Start heading back to town.
- Don't have to do investigation checks.
- None of us familiar with this area. Cob said dangerous, but mostly talked about the bird.



Albie leads us for a while, going on back.

Albie going over the trail, steps on a log, gives way underfoot, only 2 feet to go through. Feel something on feet, crwaling up leg, a bunch of insects burst out.

Start biting, leaving little red welts.

Khas runs off, starting to feel amped.

Albreich starts rolling around, 

Dank starts freaking out

Darius teleports away.

Albie jumps in water, relief, so does Dank.

Khas tries to climb a tree, no luck, climbs back down and jumps in water.

Darius is okay, Albie more bites, Dank even more, Khas the most.

Albie is under the water with a reed snorkel, Khas pinches the reed to make him gasp.

Albie tries to find plants to make an anti-itch poultice.


We start walking, get lost, start arguing over the map, Dank dissapears without us noticing. We notice after a while, Darius manages to spot some tracks. Only stopped for 10 minutes.

Start following, Darius taking the lead. Steps onto something, and foot goes through the ground what appeared to be solid ground.

See Dank 100 ft away, 50ft past that is a giant hole in the ground.

Flashback; Dank got a really strong feeling to do something; know that you need to go that way. Started walking, been going through big open field. Can hear, about time they heard us 

Dank keeps moving

Khas comes up, see's this 10ft diameter pit. See a dozen decently thick branches, sharpened and pointed up, 20ft deep. Very obviously a trap. Haven't seen anything out here to build a trap. Based on the amount of time, the water in the hole, and the marks, it's pretty fresh.

Peat moss starts to ripple and move. Surprisingly not huge frog guys shoot out of the guys, looks like they were keeping an eye on us, 6 shoot out at each group.

Albreich attempts to reason with the frogs. The frogs imply that they want to eat Dank. We give them sandwiches and rations, they jump on them, we race away.

Albreich leads us, foliage get's lighter, we get out.

People starting to do their daily routine of shutting everything down for night. We indicate that we killed the beast. The town starts partying. we can get cleaned off, party as long as we want. Get a free bath in the morning.

Come down in to the main part of the tavern. 

"Can't tell you how much i appreciate that" definitely hung over.

Informs us that there is another carriage out front.

Are there any spider folk here?

Was aroundhere for a couple weeks when I was young.

Who was this? She was a bit freaky, (like you?), was probably about 100 years ago. Went off to the city after that.

carriage rips 

Dank grabs the note "no pictures". Invitation for a light supper at one of the fancier restaurants in town, a couple hours, stll a little picture of him with a double thumbs up. From Byron

Same elevator operator.

Head on in to the city to the restaurant. Very fancy, none of us would have been here.


"Hello my wonderful employees"

How was the carriage ride, got the artifact, good shape, sit, sit.

BYron pours us wine.

Some of the best food we've ever had.

Get settled in, Byron sits back, looks less jovial than usual.

"I think it's about time I enlighten you to what we're doing at the Institue. It is an institute of collective knowledge. Strive to learn as much about the arcane and how it ties in down here, the intersections of species, surface and not surface. Found some cool things. Lesser known goal is monitoring anomalies. Normally something benign. Gettign reports of potentially dangerous situtations. Academics, not the most robust types. Thought it best to hire outside types. Put out fliers, we came forward. You did work, on both journeys. Interested in having you on more permanently. More perks, more money. Do warn you. Not going to get less dangerous.

DP: How much time to practice magic.

This next one, as opposed to the other one, is less time sensitive. Could take time. "

You are in the bargaining position.

Perks? K

B: More permanent accomadations. Nice 3.5 bedroom apartment. A little crawl space, in the better part of town. More regular salary. Provide with items, potions, etc as needed and able to provide. Pretty sweet deal.

Get's it out.

Now that you've agreed. These anomalies we're investigating, there's a collection of incidents, arcane in nature, can't pin down the specific kind of magic that's being used> Normally, you can tell when something's transmutation. Pretty well laid out. Something we've been finding doens't fall nicely. Something we haven't seen before. Looking in to it right now.

Byron keeps talking our ear off, hear something happnign in the main area. Byron is facing the opening, and his face blanches. 

Not scared, but sits up a little straighter. Look, and see two people standing there. One we recognize, Bennett, the priest we talked to. Standing behind the other person. In front of the short portly half-elf, very tall well dressed elven man. In full plate armor, which has never seen combat, very ceremonial, same deep red as the order of the Sun. So extravagant, gold trim, very long velvet cape. Strikingly handsome, yet unnerving person. Blond hair, green eyes, sunkissed (weird cause of no sun).

Hands clasped, looking at Byron, can feel the condescension. Walks up, looks at Byron. 

"Hmmm, good evening. I assume you're well"
By: Puffs chest. "Yup, entertaining some new employees. Thank you for stopping by, though.
EM: Smirks. He's a bitch, we can feel it. Looking down our nose. Looks a bit surprised, underwhelmed.Dips his head to us. "Hope you're having a wonderful evening. I'm Lazorel, I'm one of the higher priests. Just came to say hello. Hear you're working for the institute. Always good to know who's working with who in this town." Take a look at the wine "Oh, the house wine". Byron, I'll be seeing you soon. S

B: Staring in to him.


Have seen this ceremonial on the higher priest. Pressed into the breastplate, the classic 13 pointed star with an arrowhead. 

Everyone is always trying to suck up 

Dank doesn't recognize him, none of us recognize him, not even Darius.


Who the fuck is that?

By: "He's an old colleague.

K: You with teh church?

By: "Certainly not, story for another day, not on good terms. Puts on more jovial persona. After 10-15 minutes, excuses and leaves.

Server come's by with mints, and a note with details about when the new job will be.



A couple days since, Byron asks if we want anything of the more *rare* variety.


Pick some new stuff.

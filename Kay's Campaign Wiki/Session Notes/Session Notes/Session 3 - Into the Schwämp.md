### Session

- The Beast stole an old lady.

Centralized government?
- Not really. Gate is the authority, but they don't give a shit about anything outside their area.

Lots of towns further away from the Gate, only there because there is an economic reason. 

Lookout supplies a decent amount of meat. 

Little fishing villages along the sea.

A few other barely settllements elsewhere.

Spent the night at the rundown saloon.

Violet light coming in during the morning.

Task taking us in to the Schwamp. DAngerous on it's own, not including the beast.

Cob hunts in the transitional area. Used to go further in in younger days. Once you start going further in, lower light and not good sightlines. Dense as all hell, things trying to eat you.

Hopefully won't gone too long, won't need a shit load of food.

Trying to keep track of the direction it goes. Goes into the swamp, goes a little south-east. Try going that way. Should be easy, drops big feathers.

Scared of the light, or nocturnal. 
	Not sure.

Tiny rest of town. 3 main buildings. couple of houses, road turns into a trail on the way into the swamp. Stops being a trail, just on our own. As we get closer, see


Albreich starts seeing some forest man shit.  Flashing his eyes

Albreich starts in, looking for any signs of the bird. 


Albreich keeps us on track. Darius starts noticing in the canopy, a couple of feathers.


Get about an hour in, canopy tightening. Vines and stuff are starting to appear.

Start hearing something gripping very hard to a tree branch. Look up, see enourmous pretty flower above us. Stinks, and something drops.

It quiets, seems like that was the only thing to attack us in this area.

Been going about 2 hours.

Darius and Albreich are able to see exactly which way we were going. Not a lot of light coming 

Walk through the thicker and thicker swamp. 

First 2 hours, could hear distant animals existing. Now starting to notice it's harder and harder to hear the stuff around us. Sheer thickness, or lack of noise/animals.

Darius notices places that something has been repeatedly landing. 

Start to lose the trail.

Start wandering around a bit.

Silently, all of a sudden something is around me. Feel huge talons around Khas, and is able to break free.

Huge raven, kind of grungy and very much not normal. Not abnormal. Rears back, and then takes off.

Start booking it after the creature. Another hour. Making less and less ground, waist deep water most of the way. Getting darked and darker and closer, now starting to see through the gaps in the trees. See dayling coming through. Approach the edge. Old old dilapidated farmhouse. A few fields with long overgrown plants. Scarecrows, roofs half caved in. In the caved dent, there is grasses and vines nested, seems like that is where the huge raven has made it's nest. About 200ft across, 100ft to the center. This is absolutely home base.

At first cautiously step into the clearing. Halfway there, nothing happened yet.

Looks like no one has been here in years. The swamp is starting to creep in, saplings are also growing.

Go in to the house. Pretty gross dingy. The half of the roof that has caved, black grease dripping down. See an old hearth. The rest of the house is in pretty decent condition, not much of note.

See the raven coming for the house. Darius shoots off an eldritch blast. Albriech steps into invisibility, chucks a javelin,

Go check out the raven. Go check out 


Very rapidly decaying. Melts into that black oil. Only thing remaining, huge arrowhead, about 4ft long. Solid metal, heavy, large, and also weird.

Marking on the arrowhead? Not any makers marks. Seems quite old. No glyphs or runes.

Albreich tries to pick it up. At least 200lb.

Alby collects rudimentary informaiton. Seems to be sharp, although the rest of it is worn. Seems far sharper than necesarry.

Tie the ribbon around. Luminescent ribbons wrap it up, and then it all of a sudden vanishes. Accepted on the other end.

We could make it back. Hunker down for a short rest.

Darius fixes himself a little umbrella drink.


Albreich Shepherd

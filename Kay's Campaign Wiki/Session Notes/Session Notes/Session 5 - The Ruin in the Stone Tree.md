# Session

## Watching the Church

Post the fairy up to watch the church.

The mass happens, people come and go. Small garden, Bennet puttering around. Think that we've established that Bennet lives in the church, pretty standard.

Vibe we got was that corporate was here.

## Another Church Break-In

Send Dank in to the church to break into the office again, to look for information.

Dank gets the door open, go inside, same as remember it. Modest small office. Desk, nice chair, filing cabinet.

Dank gets the locked desk open. Really nice pens. Priest has one vice. pens with custom inserts.

Documents on the other side. Information about the congregation.

Find a small note in nice envelope, very nice. Signed by Lazorel. 

Has the sigil stamped on the top of it.

Dank steals it, closes everything up. 

Brings it back to the bar.

Kinda a memo. A thank you note, overly flowery, thanking for being a gracious host. Signed with the big swooping L, we trace it to use later. Dated two days ago.

- [ ] Check whether the two signatures match

Dank returns to the church, puts stuff back, locks up.

Bennet definitely is embezzling church fundraiser money that was supposed to be for fantasy CPAP machine to get fancy pens. 

If we want to get information out of Bennett, we could try to find a rare pen and use that to sway him. 

## The Next Job

About a week goes by. In the morning, little note slipped under our door.

Open the note, addressed to all four of us.

Instructions, from 

"Good morning my wonderful employees..."

Outlines our next job. Includes a map. Pretty far east. Past the Mycium grove, this is probably 3 days. Quite far away from the Gate, gonna get more rough and tumble. WEst is more geographically accessible, the east is more dense with vegetation. The ocean all the way to the east.

Spot that is marked in the map is in an area called the Petrified Forest. Used to be a surface forest, petrified wood. Huge petrified forest, technically stone/mineral. Has minimal wildlife, uninhabited, group of druids kicking back, 100s of years, don't fuck with people, granola hippy elves, going off grid.

In the instructions, the spot marked on the map is ruins? Tomb, old building, who knows. Has intel that there is a scroll there, wants his hands on. Outlines it, very old scroll, with a since forgotten spell on it, very powerful and dangerous, should be secured.

Step out of our apartment. Square out front, is a haggered looking donkey. Another note on the Driver's seat.

Albriech picks up the note. These provisions and Dan. Forgot to mention that there'll probably be more jobs out east, not just the one.

Seat two in the cart, the other two will have to walk. Good thing that Dan goes walking speed

Start getting us moving.

Get to elevator, same dwarf. Shares a piece of apple with Dan. 

## On the Road Again

The whole journey is Pretty whatever. Going and then in the evening, 

No problems through the first two days.

Beginning of the third day, entering the petrified forest. Barren, no plants save lichen. Huge petrified trees, go up 100ft, no canopy cover, pretty dense, winding road.

Dan is very adamant about not going off road.

Leave Dan tied up just off the road, and a note saying "Don't touch ;)", and Darius' fairy watching the cart in a suspicious looking way.

## Off-Road Travel

Start trucking through, very quiet and spooky. Gravel crunching under our boots is the only sound. 

Walk for about an hour. Hear what sounds like something hitting the gravel behind us.

Turn around, small animal behind us. One of the few animals from around here. Raven-gryffin. Head and shoulders of a raven, body of a large cat (Maine Coon). Scrambling around like a cat, freezes when we see it.

Albriech shoos it away. Runs and flaps it's wings, perched above us and watches us.

Albreich notices the little thing following us from a distance, seems curious about us. Scavenger, likely just associated travelers with trash. Starts creeping up closer. Eventually it starts becoming a game to the raven griffin that Alby will throw rocks to shoo them away

## The Ruins

### Ruins Exterior

About two hours in, come to a stump of a huge tree that was cut down before petrification, and has now been carved into. Modest entrance, decorated.

Peek in, landing down 15 steps.

### First Landing

Get down, see empty vestibule. Looks kind of nice. Whatever this place was made for, some significance, ornamental design around the tops of walls. Can see somewhat recently, remnants of a camp. 

How old is that camp? 20 day old camp. Looks like they were here for some time. It was a home base for some time. Across from where we came in, another set of stairs going down.

Look 

Big ornately carved archway. Inscription in drow. "Life leads us down dark roads, but sometimes it is necessary to see the light."

### The First Flight of Stairs

Heading in, 5 minutes, 10 minutes. Well hewn. Can't even see the entrance. Albreich extinguishes the torch. Darius feels Albriech let go. Darius looks around. we all look 

Tie us all together, light a torch.

Darius goes up 30 stairs, gets on the sled, closes eyes, and lets go. Just

Albreich gathers wood, makes a fire, 

Dank comes in.

Darius comes sliding in on a shield.

Khas comes in a moment later. 

### Statue Room

Now in a two story vaulted ceiling, 60ft x 15ft wide. Pillars, on each wall, big statue, depicting some sort of drow. Hunter, Healer, cook. 6, 3 on each side. At the end, dirty but very ornate mirror.

Statues not striking chords with 

Not well dressed. Each one has an accessory or something in gold, except the one on the right next to the mirror.


Go to the mirror. Very beautiful. Very well made. See herself in the mirror, see something in the background in gold.

Get someone to go up to it.

Long, curved at the end.

Dank brings it up to the mirror, big golden fishing rod. Dank can;t reach to 

Give it to Alby, fit it into the last statue. The mirror swings in to reval another staircase

25 stairs, down to anotehr 

### Branching Pathways

Hallway that then hooks to the left.

5ft hallway, 15ft and then hooks to the left. 10ft hooks to the right

Alby leaving a mark on the wall as we go. 

Far down, can see 40ish feet down. Dead end

Get there, feel around, turn around, face to face with a stone wall.

#### One Way Wall

Turn back around, up near the top, see a roughly carved in eye.

Alby holds Dank up. Stone with a shitty 

FInish the face. cover the eye

walk into the wall with 

walk backwards while facing the wall with the 

#### Trapped Hallway

Go the other way, Khas steps up, activates a trap, and gets shot with a dart.

Dank can see that it's all these pressure tiles along the way

ALby sprints along the hallway. the arrows lag behind.

Dank comes up.

Go down the stairs, Dank in the lead.

Come into a 

### Word Search

On the floor, a bunch of letters in a 5x5 grid of letters. Right in front. "You cannot enter until you find:

Darius jumps to the P. It light up red and zaps 

Khas steps on T-H-E-W-A-Y, Alby suggests I-N, all light up green, then blue, and they depress to form stairs, archway 

### The Scroll Room

Go through. little 15x15 room. In the center, pedastal with stone box on it.

At the top of the stairs, Raven griffin, has followed us in.

Dank checks out the stone box, Alby keeps an eye on the bird.

Alby pops the box, a silver scroll

Ravengriffin,

Druid drow woman, young, looks like a scamp, tattered clothes, a local of this area. Hand up like watch it bitches.

"alright, let's not get hasty, let's all calm down."
 "relax, relax, we're chill. I just need to to take this."

Its an underdark campaign, and the party is working for a scientific institute. Pretty standard fantasy flavour, and kinda silly but also kinda serious

Okay. So. Because of Lore Stuff, basically any race is acceptable, because there is a mix of underdark and regular races here and there have been for centuries. So im fine with whatever you choose. 

As for the hidden parent..... i have an idea and im gonna flesh it out and bring it to you. I would definitely be into keeping it a secret and revealing it, but if you really wanna know we can go with that too. 

As for transness, we'll say the overall attitude is that of modern day. Some people are chill with it, some are neutral, some are very angry about it. Transitions can be done a bunch of ways, including a reworked true polymorph, but that shit is expensive and most people go to the apothecary for what is essentially magical hrt, and just regular old surgeons for other stuff. 

(There is also legend of a super powerful wizard that is able to cast an insane spell that essentially rewrites reality to retcon you a different gender. This is probably just a rumor, because anyone who claims they met them has always been cis ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€)

Reskinning a class is fine with me, i love reflavouring stuff lmao. And youll start at level 6.

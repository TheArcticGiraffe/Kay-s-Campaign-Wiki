### Description
The last populated region before reaching [[The Marsh|the Swamp]].
Very Arid, prairie landscape with little to grow.

#### Dangers
[[The Beast]] is a local legend. A creature that comes at night, attacking children and [[Mud Bug|mud bugs]] alike.
We have been hired to collect a sample of this creature and return it to the institute for study.

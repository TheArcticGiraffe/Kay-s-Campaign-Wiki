A couple of lights and structures. A water tower. Old west yee-haw flavour. One strip of road. Can see huge trees with huge dark swampy forest in the distance. Lookout sits on the edge of it. about 1.5km of transition, slowly populated with trees.

In town, there are a few small corral's of livestock for town use, as well as a corral containing [[Mud Bug]]s

The main export of Lookout is hunted game, meat, and hide. In the recent years, this work has been impacted by the reign of terror of [[the Beast]].

#### Local Establishments

The town contains three commercial businesses: the [[Lookout General Store]], [[Lookout Butcher's Shop]], and the [[Lookout Saloon]].

#### Places of Interest

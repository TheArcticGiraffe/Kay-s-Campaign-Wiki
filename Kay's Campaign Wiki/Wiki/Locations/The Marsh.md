### Description

#### Environment

The swamp begins with a sparse scattering of trees, and slowly grows thicker and thicker until the light gets choked out.  It is very dense, and easy to get lost. The trees are tall and coated with vines and hanging plants.

#### Dangers

Plenty of dangerous creatures, such as the [[Corpse Flower]] or [[The Beast]]. Smaller threats like biting insects, and also [[Swamp Frogs|a carniverous group of frog folk]].

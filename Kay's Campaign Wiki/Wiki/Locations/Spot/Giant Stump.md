# Description

## Exterior

a stump of a huge tree that was cut down before petrification, and has now been carved into. Modest entrance, decorated.

## Interior

### Landing 

down 15 steps.

Get down, see empty vestibule. Looks kind of nice. Whatever this place was made for, some significance, ornamental design around the tops of walls. Can see somewhat recently, remnants of a camp. 20 day old camp (as of 0001-01-14).  Looks like they were here for some time. It was a home base for some time.

Big ornately carved archway leading to stairs heading downwards. Inscription in drow. "Life leads us down dark roads, but sometimes it is necessary to see the light."

### Stairs of Blindness

Stairs which only allow passage to the next area if you cannot see (due to darkness or eyes being closed, or something else).

### Statue Room

 a two story vaulted ceiling, 60ft x 15ft wide. Pillars, on each wall, big statue, depicting some sort of drow. Hunter, Healer, cook. 6, 3 on each side. At the end, dirty but very ornate mirror.
 
Statues not striking chords with Khas to have any meaning.

Not well dressed. Each one has an accessory or something in gold, except the one on the right next to the mirror.

### Trapped Hallways

Two hallways, one to the left and right. To the left is a hallways with a one-way wall right before a dead end, that can walked through as though nothing is there, but can only be exited by looking away from the wall.  There is a small icon of an eye on the top corner of the wall. [[Session 5 - The Ruin in the Stone Tree#One Way Wall|(source)]]

The opposite hallway is trapped with pressure plates that will cause darts to be shot from the wall when stepped on. [[Session 5 - The Ruin in the Stone Tree#Trapped Hallway|(source)]]

### Letter Gridded Room

On the floor, a bunch of letters in a 5x5 grid of letters. Right in front is an engraving reading: "You cannot enter until you find:"

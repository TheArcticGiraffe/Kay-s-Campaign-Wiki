### Description

The area of the cavern located directly under [[The Gate|the Gate]] that is within the spell producing light. Allows for traditional surface farming to be done. What is reaped from these farms is used to support the large population of the Gate. 

The farming and landscape here is truly an echo of what the surface must have been like. The light shining from the ceiling even replicates the day and night cycle that would be seen up there. This set-up of Surface-similar farming would have begun within a year of the Cataclysm.

The settlement among the Lightlands is very urban and pretty populated. It is considered to be quite safe.

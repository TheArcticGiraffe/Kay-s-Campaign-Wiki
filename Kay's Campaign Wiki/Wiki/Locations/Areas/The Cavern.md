Parent Location:: [[The Underdark]]

### Description

An unfathomably large cavern within the Underdark. 
- [ ] Is unfathomable an accurate descriptor? [tasktype:: question] [questiontype:: lore] [location:: [[The Cavern]]] 

Shaped like a flat-bottomed teardrop (think a Hershey's Kiss). At the bottom, it is very wide and doesn't seem to be a cave, only because of it's immense size. In the center, slowly rises to a point, which used to be the way that people would enter and leave the Cavern.

From the center, to the north and south are rock walls. The western boundary is a [[The Marsh|large marsh]], from which those who enter do not return. To the east, there is [[The Sea|a large underground sea]] which creates the boundary.

The west of the cavern is more geographically accessible, while the east is more dense with vegetation.
- [ ] How far in each direction are the boundaries? [tasktype:: question] [questiontype:: lore] [location:: [[The Cavern]]]


The ceiling of the cavern is covered in a bioluminescent moss, emitted brightly enough to be considered bright light. Throughout the day, the light changes hue.

# Government and Politics

The Cavern does not have a centralized government. In theory, [[The Gate]] is supposed to act as an authority for the entirety of the cavern. However, in practice it only acts in authority and provides support in as much as a settlement can provide economic benefit to the Gate.

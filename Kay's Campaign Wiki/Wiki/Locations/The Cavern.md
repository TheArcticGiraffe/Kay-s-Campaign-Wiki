Parent Location:: [[The Underdark]]

### Description

An unfathomably large cavern within the Underdark. 
- [ ] Is unfathomable an accurate descriptor? [tasktype:: question] [questiontype:: lore] [location:: [[The Cavern]]] 

Shaped like a flat-bottomed teardrop (think a Hershey's Kiss). At the bottom, it is very wide and doesn't seem to be a cave, only because of it's immense size. In the center, slowly rises to a point, which used to be the way that people would enter and leave the Cavern.

From the center, to the north and east are rock walls. The western boundary is a [[The Marsh|large marsh]], from which those who enter do not return. To the east, there is [[The Sea|a large underground sea]] which creates the boundary.
- [ ] How far in each direction are the boundaries? [tasktype:: question] [questiontype:: lore] [location:: [[The Cavern]]]


The ceiling of the cavern is covered in a bioluminescent moss, emitted brightly enough to be considered bright light. Throughout the day, the light changes hue.

| Time of Day  | Hue of Moss | Column 3   | Column 4   | Column 5   |
| ------------ | ------------|
| Morning      | Violet      | 
| Midday       | Blueish     |  
| Nighttime    | Deep Green  | 
|  |  |

Nearest Settlement:: [[The Keep]]


### Description

A large forest of fungal trees and other growths. All the fungus is connected through a mycelium network. When deep enough into the forest, the canopy closes off and blocks the view of the cavern ceiling. The fungal trees glow with their own light as well.

Primarily inhabited by [[Myconid|myconids]] and a group of [[Firbolg|firbolgs]] called [[The Shepherds]], who protect it.

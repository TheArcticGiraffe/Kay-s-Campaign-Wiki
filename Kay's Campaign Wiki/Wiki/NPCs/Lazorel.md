# Description

A very tall, strikingly handsome elven man, although there is something unnerving about him as well. Blond hair, green eyes. His skin has a color to it that is not seen on elves, a tinge of tan to it.

When we first met him, he was wearing a very ceremonial set of full plate armor. The armor is a deep red with gold trim and a long velvet cape, matching the colors of the Order of the Sun. It is clear that this armor has never seen a day of combat.

After engaging in conversation with him, it is clear that he believes he is more important than others. "He's a bitch, we can feel it."

# Notable Observations

Emblazoned on the center of Lazorel's breastplate is the same [[Arrow-Sun Sigil|sigil]] that was found on the bandits, of the 13 pointed star with an arrow-head on the north-pointing point.

People attempt to suck up to Lazorel. It is clear that he has a lot of power and influence in this city.

- [ ] Why is Lazorel's skin the color that it is?

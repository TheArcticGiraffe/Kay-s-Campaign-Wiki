### Description

An institute of arcane scientists, who hires out contract adventurers to work jobs for them. They purport that their interest, and these jobs, are simply to investigate sites of magical interest for the academic results. However, the amount of coin that is offered in return for doing a job is much more than would be expected, indicated that there is a very powerful person or group who is funding these ventures. However, the coin is too good to ignore.

#### Headquarters

Suprisingly small, first floor of a larger building. Paper sign, with the same hand drawn tabaxi nerd.  Suprisingly well put together laboratory.  Not just Byron, a few other pepole tinkering, doing science. Studying samples.  It is clear this lab has not been here for a long time.

##### Objectives:
- [ ] Keep our eye's out for anyone else employed by this [[L]]
- [ ] Hear back from Dresmar about more information about what's happening.
- [ ] Find a religious scholar in The Gate to give us information about the sigil.

##### Rewards:
- [ ] The satisfaction of knowing why people are coming after us, and the proper information to get rid of them.

### Synopsis
When on the road home from a quest, the party was set upon by a group of bandits. They were easily dealt with. When searching their bodies, they discovered [[Arrow-Sun Sigil|a strange sigil]], as well as a handful of [[L's Contract|contracts]]. The attack happened very close to The Gate; this tied with the other clues, it seems like something is strange.

### Details

- [[Dresmar Maeafin]] seems to think we were targeted. He's heard about a couple of distant colleagues taking up contracts, going out, and never coming back. All these fellows were not the cream of the crop ("Don't associate with amateurs"). He is going to reach out to his contacts and enquire about this.

### Debrief
Recount any discoveries made in the course of the quest.

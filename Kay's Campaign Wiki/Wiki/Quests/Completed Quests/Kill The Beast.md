### Synopsis

For the last 5-6 years, there have been issues with small animals, livestock, and (more recently) a child going missing in the town of [[Lookout]].

It started with garbage, and then eventually it took [[Old Lady]]'s cat. After that it went for sheep, followed by mudbugs, and most recently it made off with [[John]]'s youngest son, [[Delmar]].

The last time [[Delmar]] was seen was about 3 weeks ago.

This has all been attributed to a single creature, known as [[The Beast]].

The beast's reign of terror has been stifling for the local economy.

### Details

No one has gotten a good look at the Beast.

The beast only attacks at night. Once it gets dark, you have about 1-2 hours of being outdoors before it gets very risky.

The sample desired would be whatever the dangerous bit of the creature is; the thing that makes it stand out.

Albreich discovered a large feather. It seems that The Beast is a giant bird of some kind, or at least has feathers.

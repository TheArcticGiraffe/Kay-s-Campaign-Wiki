### Synopsis

Quest Giver: [[Dennis]]

[[Infected Myconid|A giant myconid]] is raging around [[The Keep]]. This creature stands around 10ft tall, and is a strange sickly yellow color as well as looking mishappen and twisted. It is intermitently connecting to the Keep, and this sickly yellow stuff seeps out of it and "corrupts" the surrounding forest, slowly spreading outwards. The Keep was evacuated when this thing arrived.

The party came across this creature, and shortly beat it into unconsciousness. Eventually, they decided the best course of action was to kill it. Upon it's death, it turns an ivory color (similar to the fungus all around us) and deflates in an unnatural way, turning into a small pile of old, dried mushroom. As it's color faded, it seemed like it seeped all of the corrupted color out of the forest around it.

[[Dennis]] took the dried remains of the creature.

### Synopsis

There is a very old scroll rumored to be house in [[Giant Stump|an old ruin]] found in [[the Petrified Forest]]. The quest is to retrieve the scroll and return it to Byron.  

### Details

This [[Scroll of Lost Magic|very old scroll is rumored to have a very powerful and dangerous spell]] on it which has since been forgotten.

Before arriving, we did not know what the ruins were, but upon arriving we see that it is a massive petrified stump.

We were given a map with the location of the ruins.

### Debrief

- We have made our way into the Petrified Forest, and found the ruins mentioned by Byron [[Session 5 - The Ruin in the Stone Tree#The Ruins|(source)]].
- Through a series of puzzles and tests, we managed to find our way to a room which contained a chest.
- Upon opening the chest, we saw the scroll, but just then, a ravengriffin we had seen before wildshaped into a young drow woman, and grabbed the scroll.

### Details

A great anti-magic field that was placed around [[The Gate|the Gate]]. Blocks the use of any magic (require sources on this) by anyone within the zone of the field. There are keycards distributed by the council government in order to allow the use of magic.

If you try and cast spells, nothing happnes, and then when you leave they all activate, with you being the taraget. Also includes racial magic. #cleanup 

#### Key Cards

The key cards fall into three categories; Menders and Builders, Healer, and Guards and Military.  

The Menders and Builders allows access to basic spells for the maintenance and building of construction projects around the city. 

A Healer keycard allows access to healing spells. 

A Guard and Military keycard is pretty much free reign, granting access to most kinds of magic.

Name: Dedamia 
Species: Ilithid 
Class: Wizard (Order of Scribes)


A illithid person who has left their society, feels incredibly bad about needing to feed on sentient brains. Works with the science institute, can sometimes sneak in eating a brain. 

Living in secret


Always wears a plague Doctor mask. Voice is muffled. Actually an ilithid. Order of scribes wizard, make everything psychic damages, also good at medicine. 

- Dedamia Backstory
	- Worked as a scientist/doctor in the colony. 
	- Ate a especially morally good and kind brain, empathetic. 
	- Began favouring brains from those types of people.  
	- After a while, began to internalize the empathy and kindness. 
	- Began to get upset with the idea of killing conscious creatures to continue surviving. 
	- kicked out of colony, had to run for her life. 
	- On her own, desperate, not used to the lack of connection from the elder brain, not used to not having a steady supply of brain matter to feast on. 
	- Would find lone adventurers or people lost and kill them. Tried to find bad people or people who were dying anyways, but it was not always the case. 
	- began to discover other settlements of sentient beings. Kept her distance. 
	- If she ended up having to take the brain of a good person, she would keep their belongings and anything, and write up a letter for their next of kin. If she found the settlement they lived in, would somehow work to get this back to their family/friends.
	- Slowly began getting a sense of culture and society from eating brains. Started collecting gear. Based on her build, she found women’s simple clothes, along with gloves, boots. Was not sure how to hide her face and tentacles, until she found a plague Doctor mask. 
	- Slowly began testing the waters with going to civilized areas. At first just to get supplies, then to do small jobs. Started working on doing assistant work for a doctor/physician/scientist, and then eventually got enough money to set up her own shop? Or maybe just does contract work to keep herself free. 
	- /
	- Have some of her spells present as concoctions. Gives a much cooler vibe. Have things like stinking cloud and fog cloud and fireball (spells that don’t make sense 
	- Omg, have fireball as a spell and do it in tons of different damages. She’s an alchemist! Ahhhhhh!)
	
	
 
	- AHHHH, having her overall arc of being a doctor is to heal as many lives as she stole/was complicit in. Getting a little bit towards herbalist, but her vibe is much more clinical. Is helpful, but kind of lacking the normally present niceness of the friendly neighbourhood herbalist. Not an herbalist, a doctor.

# For Sorting
Wizard:
- basic premise: mind-flayer that has gone rogue from their elder brain. Lives amongst society, hiding their species identity. Works as a medical professional. Uses this as a way to get access to fresh brains covertly. Always wears a plague Doctor outfit \[|87 Is an order of scribes wizard mechanically, maybe try reflavouring everything as different uses of its psychic abilities. 
- What are your thoughts on having an illithid PC? We’d definitely need to work out a balanced PC race template for it, but I love the idea. 
- In general, how are mind flayers viewed in your Underdark? I know in the general lore they are generally avoided and disliked.
- I want to use the Order of Scribes wizard subclass to have every spell deal psychic damage, and reflavour them as them developing their psychic mind powers. However, there are no third level spells that deal psychic damage, which sucks. I was wondering if we could homebrew a 3rd level psychic spell for them to have, to allow them to use psychic damage for all of their 3rd level spells. 
- The idea I have for them in my head is that they are primarily doing work as a doctor and medical professional primarily, as is their desire and also as a way to get access to fresh corpses for brain eating sustenance. The wizard levels is them developing their psychic abilities as they go out on expeditions and have to use them, or just their power growing. I don’t know what kind of job it is that the institute is sending out jobs for; this character could be an independent doctor who is taking up side gigs for extra money (or because they are getting hungry)

# Questions

- what is illithid society like in your world?
- How often does an illithid need to eat?
- Does an illithid need to eat sentient/conscious brains, or can they eat non-sentient things for sustenance. 
- What is the Underdark’s opinion on mind flayers? Are they accepted into societies?
- how long after brain death is a brain still functional food for an illithid?
